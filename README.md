**Project Title**
LinG3D: Visualizing the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Clonal Evolution

**Description**
This code generates the 3D lineage trees of (1) all clones; (2) individual clones; (3) all clones , but with only those cells that survived to the end of simulation; and (4) individual clones containing only those cells that survived to the end of simulation – see the quick guide to LinG3D routines.

**Dependencies**
MATLAB software (the R2020b version on a Mac computer was used for all testing)

**Executing the program**
Download all MATLAB files (add all files and folders to your MATLAB path)
Run one of the routines listed below. 

**LinG3D functions**
The following set of functions are available, and explained in detail in the quick guide to LinG3D routines.
i)	linG3DAliveAll.m
ii)	linG3DAliveClone.m
iii)	linG3DAll.m
iv)	linG3DClone.m
